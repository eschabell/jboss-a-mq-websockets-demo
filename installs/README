This directory is a staging area for a fresh installation of JBoss A-MQ from the web. Please follow these instructions before running the init.sh script in the directory above. 

(1) Download JBoss A-MQ from the JBoss Customer Portal and copy to this directory (installs). As of this writing the current version is

  * jboss-a-mq-6.1.0.redhat-379.zip

(2) Change permissions on the downloaded file to make it executable by running the following (change based on your downloaded version):

    chmod +x <path-to-project>/installs/jboss-a-mq-6.1.0.redhat-379.zip.

(3) Update the init.sh to match the downloaded file by changing changing the version number. For example, if the current version number 6.1.0.redhat-720, then change the following:

  * old VERSION=6.1.0.redhat-379

  * new VERSION=6.1.0.redhat-720
